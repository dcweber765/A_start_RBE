1) The following website was used to implement the A* algorithm in python:
    https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html
    -The team got a better understanding through this interactive website on
    how the different path searching algorithms worked. Most importantly the A*
    algorithm were a dictionary of tuples was created. This dictionary is calculated
    using the net cost of the heuristics h(n) and g(n). The dictionaries key is the
    is the parent of the value. The keys and values are tuples of x and y positions
    of the nodes (grid cells in this case).

2) We also used the template provided by the RBE3002 lab3 github repo.
